# Memory Lane Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Dashboard Navbar Now Visible After Login
**Problem**: After logging in, the dashboard screen didn't show the navigation bar.

**Solution**: Updated `components/Navbar.tsx` to detect dashboard pages and show the navbar for authenticated users. The navbar now appears on:
- Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Memories (`/memories`)
- Quizzes (`/quizzes`)
- Journal/Mood Tracker (`/journal`)
- Caregiver Insights (`/caregiver-insights`)
- Progress (`/progress`)
- Settings (`/settings`)

### 2. ✅ Back to Main Page Button Added
**Problem**: No way to easily return to the public homepage from dashboard.

**Solution**: Added a prominent "Back to Main Page" button at the top of the dashboard that routes to `/` (the public homepage).

### 3. ✅ Home Link Routing Fixed
**Problem**: The "Home" link in the top navbar was incorrectly routing to dashboard when logged in.

**Solution**: Updated the Navbar component so that:
- On public pages, "Home" always goes to `/`
- On dashboard pages, "Back to Home" goes to `/`
- The dashboard link only appears when appropriate

### 4. ✅ Subtle Hover Animations Added
**Problem**: Interactive elements lacked polish and feedback.

**Solution**: Added three CSS hover animation classes in `app/globals.css`:

#### `hover-lift`
- Slightly elevates the element on hover (translateY -4px)
- Adds a soft teal shadow for depth

#### `hover-pop`
- Scales element slightly (1.02x) on hover
- Enhances border with teal glow
- Uses smooth cubic-bezier easing

#### `card-hover`
- Lifts cards gently on hover (translateY -2px)
- Subtle shadow effect for depth

**Applied to**:
- Welcome section cards
- Stats cards (all 3)
- Quick action cards
- Encouragement section
